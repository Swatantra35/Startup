## 1. Local Development Build

### Debug Build (For Testing)

**Option A: Using Android Studio**
1. Connect your Android device via USB or start an emulator
2. Enable "Developer Options" and "USB Debugging" on your device
3. Click the green "Run" button (or press `Shift + F10`)
4. Select your device from the list
5. App will install and launch automatically

**Option B: Using Command Line**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /workspaces/Startup

# Build and install debug APK
./gradlew installDebug

# Or build APK without installing
./gradlew assembleDebug

# APK location: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

**Install APK manually:**
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

---

## 2. Generate Signed APK/AAB

### Step 1: Create a Keystore

A keystore is required to sign your app for release.

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore startup-showcase-release.keystore \
  -alias startup-showcase \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

**Follow the prompts:**
- Enter keystore password (remember this!)
- Re-enter password
- Enter your name
- Enter organizational unit
- Enter organization name
- Enter city/locality
- Enter state/province
- Enter country code (e.g., US)
- Confirm information
- Enter key password (can be same as keystore password)

**Important:** Keep this keystore file safe! You'll need it for all future updates.

### Step 2: Configure Signing in Gradle

Create a `keystore.properties` file in your project root:

```bash
# Create keystore.properties
touch keystore.properties
```

Add the following content to `keystore.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=startup-showcase
storeFile=../startup-showcase-release.keystore
```

**Add to .gitignore** (prevent committing sensitive info):
```bash
echo "keystore.properties" >> .gitignore
echo "*.keystore" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Update app/build.gradle.kts

Add this before the `android` block:

```kotlin
// Load keystore properties
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
val keystoreProperties = java.util.Properties()
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(java.io.FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    // ... existing configuration ...
    
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
            storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
            keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            isMinifyEnabled = true
            isShrinkResources = true
            proguardFiles(
                getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
                "proguard-rules.pro"
            )
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Build Release APK

```bash
# Clean previous builds
./gradlew clean

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Location: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Step 5: Build Android App Bundle (AAB) - Recommended for Play Store

```bash
# Build release AAB
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Location: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

**Why AAB?**
- Smaller download size for users
- Google Play's dynamic delivery
- Required for apps over 150MB
- Better optimization

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Keystore was tampered with"
```bash
# Solution: Verify keystore password
keytool -list -v -keystore startup-showcase-release.keystore
```

### Issue: "APK signature verification failed"
```bash
# Solution: Rebuild with correct signing config
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Issue: "App not compatible with device"
```bash
# Solution: Check minSdkVersion in build.gradle
# Ensure device meets minimum requirements (API 24+)
```

### Issue: Play Console upload fails
- **Solution**: Ensure AAB file is under 150MB
- Reduce resources, enable R8 shrinking
- Check for ProGuard errors

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit keystore files**
   - Add to `.gitignore`
   - Store securely (password manager, encrypted storage)

2. **Use environment variables for secrets**
   - CI/CD secrets
   - API keys
   - Firebase config

3. **Enable ProGuard/R8**
   - Code obfuscation
   - Resource shrinking
   - Security through obscurity

4. **Implement certificate pinning**
   - Prevent MITM attacks
   - Add to OkHttp configuration

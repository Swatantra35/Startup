## 📋 Complete Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Before You Start (One-Time Setup)

- [ ] **Firebase Setup**
  - Create Firebase project
  - Download `google-services.json`
  - Enable Authentication, Firestore, Storage
  - Configure security rules

- [ ] **Create Keystore** (for signing)
  ```bash
  ./create-keystore.sh
  ```

  - Sign up at play.google.com/console

- [ ] **Prepare Assets**
  - App icon (512x512 PNG)
  - Screenshots (min 2)
  - Feature graphic (1024x500)
  - Privacy policy URL

### 🔨 Build Process

**Option 1: Interactive (Easiest)**
```bash
./build.sh
# Select option based on need:
# 1 = Debug (testing)
# 2 = Release APK (direct distribution)
# 3 = Release AAB (Play Store)
```

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
# For Google Play Store
./gradlew bundleRelease

# For direct distribution
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### 🚀 Deployment Methods

#### Method 1: Google Play Store (Production)
**Best for: Public release, maximum reach**

1. Build AAB: `./build.sh` → Option 3
2. Go to [Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
3. Create new app
4. Upload AAB file
5. Complete store listing
6. Submit for review

**Time:** ~1 hour setup, 1-7 days review
**Cost:** $25 one-time
**Reach:** 2+ billion users

📖 **Detailed Guide:** [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#3-google-play-store-deployment](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#3-google-play-store-deployment)

---

#### Method 2: Firebase App Distribution (Beta)
**Best for: Beta testing, early access**

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init
./gradlew assembleRelease appDistributionUploadRelease
```

**Time:** ~20 minutes
**Cost:** Free
**Reach:** Your testers list

📖 **Detailed Guide:** [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#4-firebase-app-distribution-beta-testing](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#4-firebase-app-distribution-beta-testing)

---

#### Method 3: Direct APK Distribution
**Best for: Internal use, small groups**

1. Build APK: `./build.sh` → Option 2
2. Upload APK to hosting (Google Drive, website, etc.)
3. Share download link
4. Users install APK (must enable "Unknown sources")

**Time:** ~10 minutes
**Cost:** Free
**Reach:** Anyone with APK link
